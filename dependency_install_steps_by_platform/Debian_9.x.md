# Install VirtualBox

Virtualbox is the configured VM provider in this project's Vagrantfile.

Add Oracle's VirtualBox apt repository to your system's apt sources:

```
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -sc) contrib"
```

Verify that the source was added:

```
$ grep -iR virtualbox /etc/apt/sources.list*
/etc/apt/sources.list:deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian stretch contrib
/etc/apt/sources.list:# deb-src http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian stretch contrib
```

Download and register the public gpg key used by Oracle to secure the above
repository:

```
$ wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
OK
```

Verify that the key was added

```
$ apt-key list "B9F8 D658 297A F3EF C18D  5CDF A2F6 83C5 2980 AECF"
pub   rsa4096 2016-04-22 [SC]
      B9F8 D658 297A F3EF C18D  5CDF A2F6 83C5 2980 AECF
uid           [ unknown] Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox archive signing key) <info@virtualbox.org>
sub   rsa4096 2016-04-22 [E]
```

Update your local apt package metadata

```
$ sudo apt update
[...]
```

This command will show the available versions of virtualbox from the apt
repository:

```
$ sudo apt install virtualbox

## Install git

```
$ sudo apt install git
```

Most recently tested 2019-03-21 with the following git release:

```
$ git --version
git version 2.11.0
```



# Install Vagrant 2.0.3 or higher

As of this writing, the Vagrant version that Debian uses in its "stretch" release is 1.9.x so we
suggest getting a package from Vagrant's web site:

```
wget -c https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.4/vagrant_2.2.4_x86_64.deb
sudo dpkg -i vagrant_2.2.4_x86_64.deb
rm vagrant_2.2.4_x86_64.deb
```

Most recently tested 2019-03-21 with the following vagrant release:

```
$ vagrant --version
Vagrant 2.2.4
```



# Install venv support

`venv` is a python module used to create isolated project-specific environments, so that projects on
the same computer can each use their own version of the python executable and their own set of
installed python modules.

`python3-venv` is an `apt` package that includes support for using the `venv` python module.

```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

Most recently tested 2019-03-05 with the following python3-venv release:

```
$ dpkg --status python3-venv | grep Version
Version: 3.5.3-1
```



# Install direnv (Optional/Recommended)

This tool sets and unsets environment variables as you change directories in a shell session,
providing a convenient facility for setting up project-specific configuration.

```
sudo apt install direnv
```

To activate direnv when starting bash (the default shell on Debian 9), add the following line to the
end of `~/.bashrc`:

```
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
```

direnv works by incorporating a call to `_direnv_hook` in the `PROMPT_COMMAND` shell variable. You
can check that this was done by starting a new bash session and checking whether that value is
present:

```
$ echo $PROMPT_COMMAND
_direnv_hook;
```

direnv also supports several other shells -- zsh, fish, tcsh, and elvish as of this writing. Its
website includes instructions for enabling each of the shells it supports.

Most recently tested 2019-03-21 with the following direnv release:

```
$ direnv --help
direnv v2.10.0
[...]
```
